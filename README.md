# My Photography Portfolio

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my photography portfolio! This site is a curated collection of my best analog and digital photographs, reflecting my journey and growth as a photographer.

## About the Portfolio

In this portfolio, you'll find a diverse range of photographs that I've captured. From landscapes to urban snapshots, each photograph tries to tell a story and capture a moment in time. The portfolio is split into two main sections:

- **Analog:** Here, you'll find my work done using traditional film cameras like the Nikon FM2 and the Nikon F100. This section is a nod to the classic era of photography, showcasing the timeless beauty of analog.
- **Digital:** This section features my digital work, utilizing modern cameras like the Nikon D3300 and the Sony $\alpha\text{7III.}$
